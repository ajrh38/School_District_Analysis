<br />

The results clearly show that there is minimum difference in the results. This could relate to the large set of data vs the small changes done to the second analysis.
<br />
How is the district summary affected? - the affectation is very minimum
<br />
How is the school summary affected? - results of schools are almost identical
<br />
How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
<br />
the overall score decreases but almost nothing to be substantial.
